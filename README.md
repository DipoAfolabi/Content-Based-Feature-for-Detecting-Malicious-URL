# Content-Based-Feature-for-Detecting-Malicious-URL
This project employs content-based features to detect malicious URLs. Utilizing Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and scikit-learn, it analyzes and classifies URLs by extracting links and applying machine learning techniques. The goal is to efficiently identify potential security threats in URLs through automated, intelligent analysis.

Features:
-URL validation
-Web scraping to extract links
-Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization
-Classification using Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm

Prerequisites:
Before you can run this script, you'll need to install the following Python libraries:

-Pandas
-NumPy
-Requests
-BeautifulSoup
-scikit-learn

To use this script, simply run it with Python 3. Ensure that your input data is formatted correctly, typically as a DataFrame containing URLs to be processed.

Contributions are welcome! If you have improvements or bug fixes, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.

Two python code files are created and the Malicious URLs csv should be in same directory and the code files.
